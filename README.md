# DrakeGenerator
A project to see if we can use Recurrent Neural Networks to generate bars.

# About
This is a personal project where I'm experimenting with using TensorFlow to build recurrent neural networks to do language modeling.

# Usage
Currently this is a bit of a mess you can see an example of this in action by running `custom_bars.py` in a python interpreter.

Once I'm done playing around I'll make this easier to run. I promise :)
